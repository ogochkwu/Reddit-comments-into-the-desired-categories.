Despite the limitations, the model achieved 100% accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying Reddit comments into the desired categories. Further improvements could be made by collecting more data, refining the preprocessing steps, and experimenting with different machine learning algorithms to enhance the model's performance. Overall, the project accomplished its goal of creating a classifier that can accurately categorize Reddit comments according to the specified criteria.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"DndbSwbcOj2v"}}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyNIVweYABbni6PevNvEfTok"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
